        <p><h2>Summary</h2> 
            I was born in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh and grew up in Ghaziabad. Currently I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in
            computer science from Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. I love to sketch and beatbox. Currently, l am
            sharpening my coding abilities through challenging curriculum and practical application. I am always working to
            improve my abilities and keep up with the most recent trends. Python has been my favourite programming language
            ever since. <br>
            I love interacting with new people and like to treat people with respect. I enjoy helping people and I love to
            learn about new technologies.</p>
